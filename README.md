This is my final year project at the University of London

Fake News & Deepfake Detection Suite: An end-to-end solution to combat misinformation. This repository contains tools for rapid and precise identification of fake news articles and deepfake videos. Built using advanced machine learning models, it integrates content ranking mechanisms to analyze and prioritize content based on impact. Dive into our code to see how we blend textual and video content analysis to bring accuracy and efficiency into the fight against fake content.
